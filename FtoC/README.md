For this homework assignment I made code in a the eloquent javascript sandbox to create a variable called f that was equal to 99, representing 99 degrees farenheit, created a variable, c, that would be equal to the f variable - 32, then multiplied by 5/9. I then used console.log with the c variable to display the result of this equation. The one issue that I faced was a syntax error from writing`Let f = 99` which I then fixed by typing in `let f = 99` as I didn't remember that bindings are case sensitive.

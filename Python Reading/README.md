In chapter 1, one thing that I did already know was how important syntax is when dealing with formal languages such as python or mathmatical equations. One thing that I did not already know was that there are two versions of Python that use slightly different syntax. In chapter 3, one thing that I did not already know was how functions work. We had discussed this before when learning  javascript but I had forgotten. One things that I did already know was that you can combine different elements of code, such as expressions, values, variables, and operators, to do more complicated tasks in a programming language. In chapter 5, one thing that I did not already know was that there is a floor division operator in Python that will output only the integer part of the result of a division. One thing that I did already know was that Boolean expressions only have values of true or false . In chapter 10, one thing that I did not already know was that you can acess specific items of lists you made by entering the value of what number in the list the item you want to call is, with the first item on the list being 0. One thing that I did already know was that lists are sequences of values.
